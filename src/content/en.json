Still have questions? <a href='https://wa.me/351933817788' class='text-brand-accent hover:underline'>WhatsApp us</a>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Can all scratches be removed?",
        "answer": "Deep scratches that have cut through the clear coat to the primer or metal cannot be fully removed by polishing alone. We will honestly assess your surfaces and tell you what's achievable before we start."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the service take?",
        "answer": "Car polishing typically takes 2–8 hours depending on the package and vehicle size. Glass or acrylic jobs take 1–4 hours. Yacht gelcoat depends on the boat length."
      },
      {
        "question": "What areas do you cover?",
        "answer": "We cover Lisbon, Cascais, Sintra, Oeiras, Almada and surrounding municipalities. For yacht work we cover all major marinas: Cascais Marina, Oeiras Marina, Doca de Belém and more."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get a quote?",
        "answer": "The fastest way is to send us photos of the damage via WhatsApp. We respond usually within 30 minutes with an honest estimate and no obligation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is paint correction safe for my car?",
        "answer": "Yes, when performed by trained professionals with proper equipment. We always measure paint thickness before and during the process to ensure safe paint removal levels."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I save vs replacement?",
        "answer": "Typically 60–80%. A full car repaint costs €800–2,000+. Our paint correction starts at €189. Windshield replacement costs €300–500 — our glass polishing from €89. Yacht hull repaint can cost €5,000+ — our gelcoat restoration from €29/meter."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do you offer a guarantee?",
        "answer": "Yes. We offer a satisfaction promise — if you're not happy with the result, we rework it at no extra cost. Premium Ceramic packages include a 12-month coating protection warranty. The price you approve is the price you pay."
      },
      {
        "question": "What car and yacht brands do you work with?",
